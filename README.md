# Cartpole With Monte Carlo (Unfinished)

Applying an epsilon-greedy Monte Carlo algorithm to the cartpole environment using OpenAIs gym library.

See https://github.com/herougo/CartPoleWithMonteCarlo/blob/master/CartPoleMonteCarlo.ipynb for the main code.

The point of this repository was to understand the Gym library and organize a working demo of the epsilon-greedy Monte Carlo algorithm.

I tried Q learning and "solved" the game (in terms of OpenAI's definition of solved).

Credits for the Monte Carlo and Q learning code go to Denny Britz: https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/.

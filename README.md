# Cartpole With Monte Carlo

Applying an epsilon-greedy Monte Carlo algorithm to the cartpole environment using OpenAIs gym library.

See https://github.com/herougo/CartPoleWithMonteCarlo/blob/master/CartPoleMonteCarlo.ipynb for the main code.

The point of this repository was to understand the Gym library and organize a working demo of the epsilon-greedy Monte Carlo algorithm. I will investigate improving performance when I have the time.
